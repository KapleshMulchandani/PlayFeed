PlayFeed - Your Personalized Gaming News Aggregator ðŸŽ®ðŸ“°

Why I Built This App

As a gamer, keeping up with the latest news, updates, and articles about my favorite games was always a hassle. News is scattered across multiple sources, and there was no single place where I could get personalized gaming news based on my interests.

Thatâ€™s why I built PlayFeedâ€”a simple yet powerful gaming news aggregator that lets users follow their favorite games and get a curated feed of articles, updates, and news all in one place.

What PlayFeed Does

âœ… Personalized News Feed â€“ Follow specific games and get only the news that matters to you.

âœ… Two News Feeds â€“ One for games you follow, and another for general gaming news.

âœ… Seamless Browsing â€“ Tap on an article, and it opens in your default browser.

âœ… Game Discovery â€“ Easily browse through a selection of games and follow new ones.

âœ… Profile & Customization â€“ View and manage your followed games, change your password, and even delete your account if needed.
